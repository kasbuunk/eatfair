## üéØ Master Test Quality Analysis Prompt

**Use this for deep test validation of critical user journeys:**

```
Conduct a comprehensive test quality analysis for the [USER_JOURNEY] user journey in EatFair.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. **Test Discovery & Mapping**: Identify all tests covering this journey
2. **Specification Compliance**: Compare tests against PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md requirements
3. **Implementation Depth**: Analyze actual code behind the tests
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Identify missing error conditions and boundary cases
5. **Production Readiness**: Assess real-world scenario coverage
6. **User Experience Validation**: Verify tests actually prove good UX

USER JOURNEY TO ANALYZE: [INSERT_JOURNEY_NAME]
- **Primary User Type**: [Consumer/Restaurant Owner/Courier]

## üéØ Focused User Journey Analysis Templates

### Consumer Ordering Journey Analysis
```
Analyze the complete consumer ordering journey: Restaurant Discovery ‚Üí Menu Browsing ‚Üí Cart Management ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Order Tracking.

KEY VALIDATION POINTS:
- **Discovery Accuracy**: Do restaurants shown actually deliver to user's location?
- **Menu Data Integrity**: Are prices, availability, descriptions accurate and current?
- **Cart Persistence**: Does cart survive page refreshes, navigation, network issues?
- **Payment Processing**: Are financial calculations correct to the cent?
- **Order Tracking**: Do status updates reflect actual restaurant operations?

BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION:
- **Order Minimums**: Cannot checkout below restaurant's minimum order value
- **Delivery Zones**: Cannot order from restaurants outside delivery radius  
- **Payment Handling**: Failed payments don't create confirmed orders
- **Item Availability**: Unavailable items cannot be added to cart
- **Address Validation**: Delivery must be to valid, geocoded address

EDGE CASES TO VERIFY:
- Multiple users ordering from same restaurant simultaneously
- Restaurant closes/opens while user has items in cart
- Network failures during checkout process
- Invalid payment methods or insufficient funds
- Items removed from menu after being added to cart
```

### Restaurant Owner Management Journey Analysis  
```
Analyze the restaurant owner journey: Onboarding ‚Üí Profile Management ‚Üí Menu Management ‚Üí Order Processing ‚Üí Business Analytics.

KEY VALIDATION POINTS:
- **Onboarding Completeness**: Can owners fully set up their restaurant and start receiving orders?
- **Menu Management**: Real-time updates to availability, pricing, descriptions
- **Order Processing**: Accurate order information, status update capabilities
- **Financial Accuracy**: Revenue calculations, payout tracking, commission (should be 0%)
- **Operational Control**: Open/close status, delivery radius updates

BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION:
- **Authorization**: Owners can only manage their own restaurant
- **Data Integrity**: Menu changes reflect immediately on consumer side
- **Order Management**: Status updates trigger appropriate customer notifications
- **Financial Transparency**: Revenue tracking shows 100% retention (zero commission)
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes propagate to all relevant user interfaces

EDGE CASES TO VERIFY:
- Concurrent menu updates while customers are browsing
- Order status updates during high-traffic periods  
- Restaurant closure with pending orders
- Menu item availability changes during active ordering sessions
- Multiple staff members managing same restaurant account
```

### Order Tracking & Notification Journey Analysis
```
Analyze the order tracking system: Order Placement ‚Üí Status Updates ‚Üí Customer Communication ‚Üí Delivery Coordination ‚Üí Completion.

KEY VALIDATION POINTS:
- **Status Progression**: Logical progression through order lifecycle
- **Real-time Updates**: Customers and restaurants see changes immediately
- **Notification Accuracy**: Alerts sent for appropriate status changes only
- **Timeline Tracking**: Accurate timestamps and ETA calculations
- **Multi-party Coordination**: Customer, restaurant, and courier stay synchronized

BUSINESS RULE VALIDATION:
- **Status Transitions**: Only valid status changes are permitted
- **Notification Triggers**: Appropriate parties notified for each status change
- **ETA Calculations**: Delivery estimates based on real preparation and travel time
- **Cancellation Handling**: Orders can be cancelled at appropriate stages only
- **Payment Coordination**: Status changes coordinate with payment processing

## üîß Test Enhancement Patterns

### Data-Driven Test Improvements
```
For each critical user action, create comprehensive test scenarios:

HAPPY PATH VARIATIONS:
- **Minimum Valid Input**: Smallest acceptable data values
- **Maximum Valid Input**: Largest acceptable data values  
- **Typical Usage**: Most common user input patterns
- **Edge Valid Cases**: Valid but unusual input combinations

ERROR PATH SCENARIOS:
- **Invalid Input**: Malformed, missing, or out-of-range data
- **Authorization Failures**: Insufficient permissions or expired sessions
- **System Constraints**: Resource limits, rate limiting, capacity issues
- **Integration Failures**: External service outages, network problems
- **Concurrent Access**: Multiple users affecting same resources simultaneously
```

### Specification Compliance Validation
```
For each implemented feature, create tests that explicitly validate:

SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:
- **Exact Business Rules**: Test implementation matches specification exactly
- **User Experience Expectations**: Interface behavior aligns with specification vision
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput, scalability targets
- **Data Requirements**: Schema, validation, constraints match specification
- **Integration Requirements**: System boundaries and interactions as specified

ANTI-PATTERN DETECTION:
- Tests that could pass even if feature doesn't work for real users
- Tests that validate implementation rather than user value
- Tests that ignore specification requirements in favor of current implementation
- Tests that don't fail when they should (overly permissive assertions)
```
