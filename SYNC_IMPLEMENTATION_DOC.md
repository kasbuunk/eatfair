# Sync Implementation Document

*One-liner prompt to quickly sync PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md with actual tested state.*

---

## Quick Sync One-Liner

```
Sync PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md to actual tested implementation state by running tests, analyzing specification compliance, and updating documentation to reflect reality.
```

---

## What This Does

This one-liner prompt will:
1. **Run the test suite** to see what actually works
2. **Analyze specification compliance** for all implemented features
3. **Update PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md** with accurate status
4. **Mark features correctly** based on specification alignment (not just test coverage)
5. **Recalculate MVP progress** based on actual specification compliance
6. **Document technical debt** and specification violations

## When to Use

Run this one-liner:
- **Before using START_FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT.md** to ensure accurate starting state
- **After pulling latest changes** to sync documentation with codebase
- **Before important meetings** to have accurate progress reporting
- **When documentation feels out of sync** with actual capabilities
- **As part of regular development hygiene** (weekly/bi-weekly)

## Expected Output

After running this prompt, you should get:
- **Updated PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md** reflecting actual specification compliance
- **Corrected feature statuses** (âœ…/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´) based on specification analysis
- **Realistic MVP progress percentage** based on true completeness
- **Documented specification gaps** and technical debt
- **Clear next development priorities** based on actual gaps

---

*Use this before START_FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT.md to ensure the development prompt works with accurate, up-to-date information.*
