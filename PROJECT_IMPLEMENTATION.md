# EatFair Project Implementation

*This document bridges the PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md to executable end-to-end tests and tracks feature development progress. It serves as the single source of truth for implementation status and test coverage.*

## Implementation Philosophy

This document follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach where:
- **End-to-end tests** are the executable specifications that prove feature implementation
- **User journeys** are implemented as delightful-to-read test suites
- **Progress** is measured by test coverage, not code volume
- **Quality** is ensured through fast, comprehensive feedback loops
