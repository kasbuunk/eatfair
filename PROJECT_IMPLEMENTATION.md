# EatFair Project Implementation

*This document bridges the PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md to executable end-to-end tests and tracks feature development progress. It serves as the single source of truth for implementation status and test coverage.*

## Implementation Philosophy

This document follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach where:
- **End-to-end tests** are the executable specifications that prove feature implementation
- **User journeys** are implemented as delightful-to-read test suites
- **Progress** is measured by test coverage, not code volume
- **Quality** is ensured through fast, comprehensive feedback loops

**Priority**: Immediate - Blocking Customer Orders â†’ **RESOLVED**

**Issue Resolution**: Successfully identified and fixed the root cause where users had `default_address` strings but no actual Address records in the database.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- Users were created with `default_address` strings stored on the User record
- The delivery system was looking for Address records with geocoded coordinates
- **No Address records were being created** from the default_address strings
- This caused "Delivery not available" for all customers including Test Customer

**Implementation Results**:

âœ… **Dutch Address Parsing**: Implemented address parser for Dutch format "Street #, #### XX City"  
âœ… **Automatic Geocoding**: Address records are now properly geocoded with coordinates via Accounts.create_address/1  
âœ… **Default Address Flags**: Address records are properly marked as `is_default: true`  
âœ… **All Users Fixed**: Every user now has proper Address records instead of just string fields  
âœ… **Test Customer Resolution**: Test Customer now has Address record with coordinates (lat: 52.3676, lon: 4.9041)  
âœ… **Test Suite Health**: All 163 tests continue passing after the fix  
âœ… **Delivery System Compatibility**: Delivery calculations now work with actual Address records  

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `priv/repo/seeds.exs` with `parse_dutch_address/1` function
- Automatically creates Address records for all users with default_address strings
- Parses Dutch postal code format (#### XX) and city names correctly
- Handles geocoding through existing Accounts.create_address/1 pipeline
- Maintains backward compatibility with User.default_address field

**Success Criteria Achieved**:
âœ… Test Customer in Central Amsterdam can now successfully order from nearby restaurants
