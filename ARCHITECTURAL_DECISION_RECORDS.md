# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

*This document captures key architectural decisions, technical debt, and design philosophy for the EatFair project.*

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Choose simple, proven solutions over cutting-edge complexity
- **Community Over Scale**: Optimize for community empowerment rather than massive scale
- **Speed Over Perfection**: MVP excellence through rapid iteration, not perfect architecture
- **Tests Over Documentation**: Executable tests are the primary source of truth
- **User Experience First**: Every technical decision should improve user experience

### Decision-Making Framework
1. **Does it serve the mission?** (Entrepreneur empowerment)
2. **Does it improve user experience?** (Consumers and restaurant owners)
3. **Is it simple to implement and maintain?** (MVP focus)
4. **Does it support fast feedback loops?** (TDD approach)
5. **Is it cost-effective for a donation-based model?** (Lean operations)

## ADR-001: Phoenix LiveView as Primary Frontend Framework

**Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted  
**Date**: Project Inception  
**Context**: Need to choose frontend approach for real-time food ordering platform

### Decision
Use Phoenix LiveView as the primary frontend framework with minimal JavaScript.

### Rationale
- **Real-time by Default**: Perfect for order tracking, restaurant notifications
- **Single Language**: Elixir for both backend and frontend logic
- **Rapid Development**: No API layer needed, direct database to UI
- **SEO Friendly**: Server-rendered HTML with progressive enhancement
- **Community Alignment**: Elixir community values match project mission

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Fast development, real-time updates, single deployment
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Limited mobile app options, learning curve for traditional web devs
- üîÑ **Mitigations**: Progressive Web App (PWA) approach for mobile experience

### Implementation Notes
- Use Phoenix v1.8 patterns with `<Layouts.app>` wrappers
- Leverage LiveView streams for performance with collections
- Minimal custom JavaScript, use Phoenix.JS hooks when needed

## ADR-002: SQLite for MVP Database

**Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted  
**Date**: Project Inception  
**Context**: Choose database solution balancing simplicity with functionality

### Decision  
Use SQLite for MVP development and initial deployment.

### Rationale
- **Zero Configuration**: No database server setup or management
- **Single File Deployment**: Simplifies backup and migration
- **Phoenix Integration**: Excellent Ecto support via `:ecto_sqlite3`
- **Cost Efficiency**: No database hosting costs for MVP phase
- **Sufficient Scale**: Handles thousands of concurrent users easily

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple deployment, no hosting costs, easy backup/restore
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Limited concurrent writes, no built-in replication
- üîÑ **Migration Path**: PostgreSQL when write concurrency becomes limiting

### Implementation Notes
- Use Ecto migrations for schema management
- Regular SQLite backups to prevent data loss
- Monitor write contention as user base grows

## ADR-003: Scope-Based Authentication System

**Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted  
**Date**: Project Inception  
**Context**: Support multiple user types (consumers, restaurant owners, couriers)

### Decision
Extend `phx.gen.auth` with scope-based authentication rather than role-based.

### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: Easier to add new user types (couriers, admins)
- **Phoenix Integration**: Built on proven `phx.gen.auth` foundation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each user type has dedicated context
- **Security**: Isolated authentication flows per user type

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Clear user type separation, extensible architecture
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex than simple role system
- üîÑ **Implementation**: Use `@current_scope.user` instead of `@current_user`

### Implementation Notes
- Scopes defined in `config/config.exs`
- Separate `live_session` blocks for different auth requirements
- Custom login flows per scope as needed

## ADR-004: Test-First Development Approach

**Status**: ‚úÖ Adopted  
**Date**: Project Inception  
**Context**: Ensure high-quality, maintainable codebase for mission-critical platform

### Decision
Enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all feature development.

### Rationale
- **Quality Assurance**: Every feature proven to work through tests
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
- **Confidence**: Safe refactoring and feature additions
- **Design**: TDD drives better API design

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: High code quality, living documentation, regression prevention
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Slower initial development, requires discipline
- üîÑ **Mitigation**: Focus on end-to-end tests over unit tests for speed

### Implementation Notes
- End-to-end tests using Phoenix.LiveViewTest
- Delightful test readability as primary goal
- Fast test suite (< 30 seconds) for quick feedback loops
