## üéØ Comprehensive Prompt System Guide

### How to Use the Tag-Based Prompt System

**The EatFair project uses a modular, tag-based prompt system with two types:**

#### Main Task Categories (Complete Workflows)
Use these for end-to-end work processes:
- **#feature_dev** ‚Üí `prompts/feature_dev.md` - Implement new features using TDD
- **#debug_bug** ‚Üí `prompts/debug_bug.md` - Systematically investigate and fix bugs  
- **#product_strategy** ‚Üí `prompts/product_strategy.md` - Plan product direction and prioritization
- **#test_author** ‚Üí `prompts/test_author.md` - Create comprehensive test coverage
- **#support_triage** ‚Üí `prompts/support_triage.md` - Process user feedback and issues
- **#code_orient** ‚Üí `prompts/code_orient.md` - Understand unfamiliar codebase structure
- **#env_setup** ‚Üí `prompts/env_setup.md` - Set up development environments
- **#quick_fix** ‚Üí `prompts/quick_fix.md` - Implement small, low-risk changes
- **#refactor** ‚Üí `prompts/refactor.md` - Improve code quality without changing behavior
- **#incident_resp** ‚Üí `prompts/incident_resp.md` - Handle production incidents

#### Building Blocks (Composable Steps)
Use these for specific workflow steps:
- **#context_intake** ‚Üí `prompts/context_intake.md` - Gather requirements and understand work
- **#test_plan** ‚Üí `prompts/test_plan.md` - Design comprehensive test coverage
- **#write_tests** ‚Üí `prompts/write_tests.md` - Create tests following TDD principles
- **#impl_change** ‚Üí `prompts/impl_change.md` - Make code changes with quality safeguards
- **#run_all_tests** ‚Üí `prompts/run_all_tests.md` - Execute and validate test suite
- **#create_repro** ‚Üí `prompts/create_repro.md` - Create bug reproduction test cases
- **#isolate_cause** ‚Üí `prompts/isolate_cause.md` - Systematically find root causes
- **#route_task** ‚Üí `prompts/route_task.md` - Classify and route incoming work requests
- **#doc_update** ‚Üí `prompts/doc_update.md` - Update project documentation

### üîç Prompt Discovery and Usage

#### When User Includes Tags
1. **Identify Tags**: Look for `#tag` patterns in user requests
2. **Find Prompt Files**: Tags map directly to filenames: `#feature_dev` ‚Üí `prompts/feature_dev.md`
3. **Read Full Prompt**: Load the complete prompt content and follow its guidance
4. **Apply Configuration**: Reference `prompts_config/` files for EatFair-specific customizations

#### When No Tags Present
1. **Apply Classification**: Use `#route_task` to classify the type of work
2. **Suggest Appropriate Tags**: Recommend relevant prompts based on work type
3. **Compose Workflow**: Chain multiple prompts if complex work is needed

#### Fallback Strategy When Prompt Not Found
1. **Check Similar Categories**: Look for related prompts that might cover the work
2. **Compose from Building Blocks**: Combine building block prompts to create workflow
3. **Use Generic Patterns**: Apply closest existing prompt with modifications
4. **Request Clarification**: Ask user to refine request or provide more specific category

### üìã Tag Composition Patterns

#### Sequential Composition (Pipeline)
```
"Apply #context_intake then #test_plan then #write_tests for user authentication"
```
‚Üí Chain building blocks in sequence for complex workflows

#### Conditional Composition (Routing)
```
"Use #route_task to determine if this needs #feature_dev or #debug_bug"
```
‚Üí Use routing to select appropriate main workflow

#### Configuration Integration
```
"Use #feature_dev with Phoenix LiveView patterns for real-time notifications"
```
‚Üí Apply main workflow with technology-specific configuration

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

#### EatFair-Specific Customizations
All prompts reference configuration files in `prompts_config/`:
- **tech_stack.md** - Phoenix/Elixir patterns and conventions
- **project_context.md** - EatFair business domain and requirements  
- **workflows.md** - Development processes and backlog management
- **quality_standards.md** - Testing approaches and quality gates

#### How Configuration Works
1. **Generic Prompt**: Provides methodology and universal best practices
2. **Configuration Override**: Adds project-specific patterns and requirements
3. **Context Integration**: Applies business domain knowledge and constraints
4. **Workflow Alignment**: Ensures consistency with EatFair development processes

### üöÄ Usage Examples

#### Simple Usage
```
"Use #debug_bug to fix the cart calculation error"
```
‚Üí Applies complete debugging workflow with EatFair configuration

#### Building Block Composition
```
"Apply #context_intake then #isolate_cause to understand this performance issue"
```
‚Üí Explicitly chains specific building blocks

#### Technology Integration
```
"Use #feature_dev with Phoenix LiveView patterns to implement real-time chat"
```
‚Üí Applies development workflow with technology-specific guidance

### üîó Prompt Network

**Complete workflow map**: See `prompts/PROMPT_NETWORK.md` for visual dependency mapping

**Cross-references**: Each prompt includes "Related Prompts" section showing:
- **Prerequisites**: What to use before this prompt
- **Complements**: What works alongside this prompt  
- **Follows**: What to use after this prompt

### üìñ Legacy Prompt Migration

**Old System** (Deprecated):
- File-based references like `prioritize_work.md`
- Monolithic prompts with mixed concerns
- Project-specific content mixed with generic guidance

**New System** (Current):
- Tag-based references like `#product_strategy`
- Modular prompts with single responsibilities
- Clean separation of generic methodology and project configuration

**Migration Guide**:
- Replace file references with tag references
- Use building block composition instead of monolithic prompts
- Apply configuration system for project-specific customization
