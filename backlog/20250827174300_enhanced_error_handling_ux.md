### History / Log
* 2025-08-27 17:43:00: Item created from legacy work items migration.
* 2025-08-27 20:47:00: Fixed critical location search filter crash bug - added missing `{:error, :invalid_input}` case handling in Discovery LiveView. All geocoding error cases now handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback messages. Added comprehensive tests to prevent regression.
* 2025-08-29 04:55:00: Implemented comprehensive timezone-aware delivery time selection system:
  - Added comprehensive restaurant operational hours (contact, order, kitchen, delivery windows)
  - Implemented 15-minute granularity delivery time options with proper ceiling rounding
  - Added explicit timezone display and context throughout order flow
  - Created restaurant closed state handling with next opening time calculation
  - Added robust validation system to prevent edge cases and abuse
  - Comprehensive test coverage for operational hours and timezone handling
  - Enhanced UI with timezone indicators and clear restaurant status messaging
* 2025-08-30 05:57:00: Fixed critical restaurant availability consistency bug:
  - Discovery page "open for orders" filter now uses Restaurant.open_for_orders?/1
  - Eliminated inconsistency where filtered restaurants appeared open but were actually closed
  - Added comprehensive integration tests to prevent regression
  - Established single source of truth for availability checks across the application
