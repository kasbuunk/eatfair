## Description

This comprehensive overhaul addresses multiple critical issues identified through hands-on testing of the restaurant order management system. The feedback reveals fundamental UX problems and missing courier integration that prevents the completion of the full delivery journey.

## User Feedback Summary

**From manual testing session:**
- Navigation: Missing navbar on `/restaurant/orders` prevents returning to homepage
- Order Overview: Current card-based view too verbose, needs concise table view
- Order Details: Missing dedicated order detail pages
- Historic Orders: Can't see completed order history
- Courier Integration: Missing courier visibility and batch delivery management
- Delivery Staging: Need planning phase for grouping orders into delivery batches
- Role Separation: Need dedicated courier accounts and workflow

## Analysis Using Process Feedback Framework

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL BUGS (Production Blockers)
1. **Missing Navigation**: No navbar on order tracking page prevents navigation
2. **Missing Historic Orders**: Restaurant owners cannot see completed orders
3. **No Courier Access**: Couriers mentioned in README but cannot login or access system

### ðŸŸ¡ USER EXPERIENCE ISSUES (High Priority)
1. **Verbose Order Cards**: Current card view too detailed for overview, needs table format
2. **No Order Detail Pages**: Cannot view detailed information for specific orders
3. **Poor Order Status Visibility**: Hard to distinguish between preparation and delivery stages
4. **Missing Courier Coordination**: Restaurant cannot see courier status or plan deliveries

### ðŸ”µ SPECIFICATION GAPS (Feature Development)
1. **Delivery Batch Management**: Need system for grouping orders for efficient delivery
2. **Courier Dashboard**: Couriers need interface to accept/manage delivery batches
3. **Dual Status Tracking**: Separate preparation status from delivery status
4. **Real-time Courier Communication**: Restaurant and courier need live status updates
