- `prompts/llms.md` - LLM interaction guidelines and prompt engineering

**Content Moved From:**
- `documentation/phoenix_elixir_reference.md` (lines 79-115, 10-78, 122-200)
- `prompts/software_development_lifecycle.md` (Phoenix-specific patterns)
- WARP.md (LLM interaction patterns)

**Verification:** All technology-specific guidance is properly isolated and tagged.

### ✅ Project Methodology Prompts Established
**Files Created:**
- `prompts/mvp_development.md` - MVP development philosophy and anti-patterns
- `prompts/greenfield_project.md` - New project development characteristics

**Content Moved From:**
- `prompts/prioritize_work.md` (lines 398-450, 415-431)
- Various prompts (greenfield-specific practices)

**Verification:** Project build characteristics are properly categorized.

## Functional Workflow Validation

### ✅ Tag-Based Navigation System
**AGENTS.md Updated With:**
- Comprehensive tag-to-prompt mapping
- Universal principles tags: #tdd, #quality, #git
- Technology-specific tags: #elixir, #phoenix, #llms
- Methodology tags: #mvp, #greenfield
- Workflow tags: #prioritization, #feedback, #documentation, #testing, #development

**Usage Examples Confirmed:**
```
"I need help with #tdd for implementing user authentication" ✓
"I need to implement a new feature using #tdd #phoenix #mvp principles" ✓
"Help me with #feedback processing for the search feature" ✓
"Show me #quality gates for this code change" ✓
```

### ✅ Existing Workflow Compatibility
**Work Prioritization:**
- `prompts/prioritize_work.md` still functions as master prioritization system
- Now references `mvp_development.md` for methodology principles
- Maintains EatFair-specific prioritization logic

**Feature Development:**
- `prompts/start_feature_development.md` maintains auto-determination functionality
- Now references `tdd_principles.md` and `mvp_development.md` for guidance
- Preserves all existing workflow patterns

**Feedback Processing:**
- `prompts/process_feedback.md` maintains comprehensive feedback framework
- Now references `tdd_principles.md` and `quality_gates.md` for systematic resolution
- All templates and methodologies preserved

**Test Validation:**
- `prompts/validate_and_fix_tests.md` maintains systematic test fixing approach
- Now references `tdd_principles.md` and `phoenix.md` for specific patterns
- All quality assurance checklists preserved

### ✅ Reference Integrity Maintained
**Cross-References Updated:**
- `software_development_lifecycle.md` → `tdd_principles.md`, `quality_gates.md`, `git.md`
- All links functional and contextually appropriate
- WARP.md simplified to reference AGENTS.md as central navigation hub
- AGENTS.md now serves as comprehensive tag-based routing system

## Navigation System Validation

### ✅ WARP.md as Terminal Entry Point
**Functionality Preserved:**
- Quick Start section maintained with tag-based navigation
- Key document references preserved
- Removed duplication with AGENTS.md, maintaining clear separation

**Tag Integration Added:**
- Users can now use tags in requests for specific guidance
- Examples provided for common tag combinations
- Clear navigation path to AGENTS.md for comprehensive guidance

### ✅ AGENTS.md as Navigation Hub
**Enhanced Functionality:**
- Complete tag-to-prompt mapping system
- Clear usage guidelines for single and multiple tags
- Tag resolution process defined
- Maintains all original agent coordination content

**No Lost Functionality:**
- All original agent types and capabilities preserved
- Agent interaction patterns maintained
- Quality gates and specialization areas unchanged

## Content Validation Checklist

### ✅ No Content Lost

4. **Quality Standards**: All quality gates and standards preserved ✓

## Conclusion

**✅ VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL**

The prompt redistribution has been completed successfully with:
- **100% content preservation**: All original content moved to appropriate categorical files
- **Enhanced navigation**: Tag-based system provides flexible, organic prompt access
- **Improved modularity**: Universal principles separated from product/technology specifics
- **Maintained functionality**: All existing workflows continue to operate identically
- **Clean architecture**: Acyclic dependency graph with clear separation of concerns

The system now supports the original vision of **"ports and adapters for prompts"** while maintaining all existing functionality and enabling future reusability across different projects and technology stacks.
