# EatFair Work Prioritization System

Tags: #prioritization #eatfair #mvp

*Intelligent work prioritization for early-stage MVP development - recognizes project state and balances feature development with quality engineering.*

**Foundation**: This system applies universal work prioritization principles with EatFair-specific context. For foundational concepts, see:
- **MVP Methodology**: [MVP Development](mvp_development.md) for early-stage principles and anti-patterns
- **TDD Approach**: [TDD Principles](tdd_principles.md) for test-driven development cycle
- **Quality Standards**: [Quality Gates](quality_gates.md) for comprehensive quality requirements

## üéØ Master Prioritization Prompt

**Use this as your primary work prioritization command:**

```
Analyze EatFair's current state and recommend the most impactful work to do right now.

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
1. **Current Implementation Status**: Run tests and analyze PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
2. **Specification Compliance**: Compare implementation against PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md  
3. **Technical Health**: Assess code quality, test coverage, and technical debt
4. **User Experience Gaps**: Identify critical UX issues affecting adoption
5. **Project Phase**: We're in early-stage MVP development (nothing in production yet)

PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:
- **MVP-Critical Features** (Block user adoption if missing)
- **Quality Engineering** (Foundation for sustainable growth) 
- **Technical Debt** (Becoming limiting factors)
- **User Experience Polish** (Improving conversion and satisfaction)
- **Documentation/Process** (Enabling faster development)

## üéØ Context-Aware Decision Framework

### Early-Stage Development Principles

**Current Reality**: 
- No production users yet
- ~65% MVP completion with excellent test coverage
- SQLite perfectly adequate for scale
- Focus should be on working software, not premature optimization

**Prioritization Rules**:
1. **User-facing functionality** > Internal tools
2. **Core business value** > Nice-to-have features  
3. **Working software** > Perfect architecture
4. **Test coverage** > Code elegance
5. **Restaurant owner success** > Platform optimization

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**‚ùå Premature Scaling**:
- Migrating to PostgreSQL (SQLite handles thousands of users)
- Complex caching systems (LiveView handles real-time efficiently)
- Microservices architecture (monolith is perfect for current scale)

**‚ùå Over-Engineering**:
- Abstract frameworks before patterns are clear
- Complex deployment pipelines (simple Fly.io deployment works)
- Elaborate monitoring systems (basic error tracking sufficient)

**‚ùå Feature Creep**:
- Advanced meal customization (Post-MVP feature)
- Multi-language support (Focus on single market first)
- Advanced analytics dashboards (Basic metrics sufficient)

### ‚úÖ Smart Early-Stage Choices

**Feature Development**:
- Complete core user journeys (order tracking, restaurant discovery)
- Fix specification violations (review system business logic)
- Simple, working solutions over complex perfect ones

**Quality Engineering**:
- Maintain fast test suite (< 30 seconds)
- Keep code readable and maintainable
- Document architectural decisions in ADRs

**User Experience**:
- Focus on restaurant owner delight (they're the key users)
- Ensure consumer experience drives repeat usage
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
