# Phoenix Framework Guidelines

*Phoenix-specific patterns, conventions, and best practices for building robust web applications.*

## Phoenix v1.8 Guidelines

- **Always** begin your LiveView templates with `<Layouts.app flash={@flash} ...>` which wraps all inner content
- The `MyAppWeb.Layouts` module is aliased in the `my_app_web.ex` file, so you can use it without needing to alias it again
- Anytime you run into errors with no `current_scope` assign:
  - You failed to follow the Authenticated Routes guidelines, or you failed to pass `current_scope` to `<Layouts.app>`
  - **Always** fix the `current_scope` error by moving your routes to the proper `live_session` and ensure you pass `current_scope` as needed
- Phoenix v1.8 moved the `<.flash_group>` component to the `Layouts` module. You are **forbidden** from calling `<.flash_group>` outside of the `layouts.ex` module
- Out of the box, `core_components.ex` imports an `<.icon name=\"hero-x-mark\" class=\"w-5 h-5\"/>` component for for hero icons. **Always** use the `<.icon>` component for icons, **never** use `Heroicons` modules or similar
- **Always** use the imported `<.input>` component for form inputs from `core_components.ex` when available. `<.input>` is imported and using it will will save steps and prevent errors
- If you override the default input classes (`<.input class=\"myclass px-2 py-1 rounded-lg\">)`) class with your own values, no default classes are inherited, so your custom classes must fully style the input

## Authentication Patterns

- **Always** handle authentication flow at the router level with proper redirects
- **Always** be mindful of where to place routes. `phx.gen.auth` creates multiple router plugs and `live_session` scopes:
  - A plug `:fetch_current_user` that is included in the default browser pipeline
  - A plug `:require_authenticated_user` that redirects to the log in page when the user is not authenticated
  - A `live_session :current_user` scope - For routes that need the current user but don't require authentication, similar to `:fetch_current_user`
  - A `live_session :require_authenticated_user` scope - For routes that require authentication, similar to the plug with the same name
  - In both cases, a `@current_scope` is assigned to the Plug connection and LiveView socket
  - A plug `redirect_if_user_is_authenticated` that redirects to a default path in case the user is authenticated - useful for a registration page that should only be shown to unauthenticated users
- **Always let the user know in which router scopes, `live_session`, and pipeline you are placing the route, AND SAY WHY**
- `phx.gen.auth` assigns the `current_scope` assign - it **does not assign a `current_user` assign**.
- To derive/access `current_user`, **always use the `current_scope.user` assign**, never use **`@current_user`** in templates or LiveViews
- **Never** duplicate `live_session` names. A `live_session :current_user` can only be defined __once__ in the router, so all routes for the `live_session :current_user`  must be grouped in a single block
- Anytime you hit `current_scope` errors or the logged in session isn't displaying the right content, **always double check the router and ensure you are using the correct plug and `live_session` as described below**

### Routes that require authentication

LiveViews that require login should **always be placed inside the __existing__ `live_session :require_authenticated_user` block**:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      live_session :require_authenticated_user,
        on_mount: [{EatfairWeb.UserAuth, :require_authenticated}] do
        # phx.gen.auth generated routes
        live "/users/settings", UserLive.Settings, :edit
        live "/users/settings/confirm-email/:token", UserLive.Settings, :confirm_email
        # our own routes that require logged in user
        live "/", MyLiveThatRequiresAuth, :index
      end
    end

Controller routes must be placed in a scope that sets the `:require_authenticated_user` plug:

    scope "/", AppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated_user]

      get "/", MyControllerThatRequiresAuth, :index
    end

### Routes that work with or without authentication

LiveViews that can work with or without authentication, **always use the __existing__ `:current_user` scope**, ie:

    scope "/", MyAppWeb do
      pipe_through [:browser]

      live_session :current_user,
        on_mount: [{EatfairWeb.UserAuth, :mount_current_scope}] do
        # our own routes that work with or without authentication
        live "/", PublicLive
      end
    end

Controllers automatically have the `current_scope` available if they use the `:browser` pipeline.

## Phoenix Router Guidelines

- Remember Phoenix router `scope` blocks include an optional alias which is prefixed for all routes within the scope. **Always** be mindful of this when creating routes within a scope to avoid duplicate module prefixes.

- You **never** need to create your own `alias` for route definitions! The `scope` provides the alias, ie:

      scope "/admin", AppWeb.Admin do
        pipe_through :browser

        live "/users", UserLive, :index
      end

  the UserLive route would point to the `AppWeb.Admin.UserLive` module

- `Phoenix.View` no longer is needed or included with Phoenix, don't use it

## Ecto Integration

- **Always** preload Ecto associations in queries when they'll be accessed in templates, ie a message that needs to reference the `message.user.email`
- Remember `import Ecto.Query` and other supporting modules when you write `seeds.exs`
- `Ecto.Schema` fields always use the `:string` type, even for `:text`, columns, ie: `field :name, :string`
- `Ecto.Changeset.validate_number/2` **DOES NOT SUPPORT the `:allow_nil` option**. By default, Ecto validations only run if a change for the given field exists and the change value is not nil, so such as option is never needed
- You **must** use `Ecto.Changeset.get_field(changeset, :field)` to access changeset fields
- Fields which are set programatically, such as `user_id`, must not be listed in `cast` calls or similar for security purposes. Instead they must be explicitly set when creating the struct

## Phoenix HTML and Templates

- Phoenix templates **always** use `~H` or .html.heex files (known as HEEx), **never** use `~E`
- **Always** use the imported `Phoenix.Component.form/1` and `Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` function to build forms. **Never** use `Phoenix.HTML.form_for` or `Phoenix.HTML.inputs_for` as they are outdated
- When building forms **always** use the already imported `Phoenix.Component.to_form/2` (`assign(socket, form: to_form(...))` and `<.form for={@form} id=\"msg-form\">`), then access those forms in the template via `@form[:field]`
- **Always** add unique DOM IDs to key elements (like forms, buttons, etc) when writing templates, these IDs can later be used in tests (`<.form for={@form} id=\"product-form\">`)
- For "app wide" template imports, you can import/alias into the `my_app_web.ex`'s `html_helpers` block, so they will be available to all LiveViews, LiveComponent's, and all modules that do `use MyAppWeb, :html` (replace "my_app" by the actual app name)

### HEEx Template Patterns

- Elixir supports `if/else` but **does NOT support `if/else if` or `if/elsif`. **Never use `else if` or `elseif` in Elixir**, **always** use `cond` or `case` for multiple conditionals.

  **Never do this (invalid)**:

      <%= if condition do %>
        ...
      <% else if other_condition %>
        ...
      <% end %>

  Instead **always** do this:

      <%= cond do %>
        <% condition -> %>
          ...
        <% condition2 -> %>
          ...
        <% true -> %>
          ...
      <% end %>

- HEEx require special tag annotation if you want to insert literal curly's like `{` or `}`. If you want to show a textual code snippet on the page in a `<pre>` or `<code>` block you *must* annotate the parent tag with `phx-no-curly-interpolation`:

      <code phx-no-curly-interpolation>
        let obj = {key: "val"}
      </code>

  Within `phx-no-curly-interpolation` annotated tags, you can use `{` and `}` without escaping them, and dynamic Elixir expressions can still be used with `<%= ... %>` syntax

- HEEx class attrs support lists, but you must **always** use list `[...]` syntax. You can use the class list syntax to conditionally add classes, **always do this for multiple class values**:

      <a class={[
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5",
        if(@other_condition, do: "border-red-500", else: "border-blue-100"),
        ...
      ]}>Text</a>

  and **always** wrap `if`'s inside `{...}` expressions with parens, like done above (`if(@other_condition, do: "...", else: "...")`)

  and **never** do this, since it's invalid (note the missing `[` and `]`):

      <a class={
        "px-2 text-white",
        @some_flag && "py-5"
      }> ...

## LiveView Patterns

### Socket State Management
- Use `assign/3` for simple state updates
- Use `update/3` for more complex state transformations
- Use `stream/4` for collections to avoid memory issues
- Handle disconnections and reconnections gracefully

### Event Handling
- Use descriptive event names that indicate the action
- Pattern match on event parameters for clarity
- Return appropriate socket states from event handlers
- Handle both success and error cases

### Performance Optimization
- Use LiveView streams for large collections instead of assigns
- Minimize data sent over the socket
- Use temporary assigns for large data that doesn't need to persist
- Implement efficient update patterns

### Testing LiveView
- Use `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` for comprehensive testing
- Test user interactions, not just state changes
- Use `has_element?/2` for asserting element presence
- Test both connected and disconnected states

## Mix and Development Tools

- Read the docs and options before using tasks (by using `mix help task_name`)
- To debug test failures, run tests in a specific file with `mix test test/my_test.exs` or run all previously failed tests with `mix test --failed`
- `mix deps.clean --all` is **almost never needed**. **Avoid** using it unless you have good reason
