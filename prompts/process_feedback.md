## üìã **FEEDBACK PROCESSING FRAMEWORK**

When invoked with feedback, follow this comprehensive analysis and implementation framework:

### **PHASE 1: FEEDBACK ANALYSIS & CATEGORIZATION**

#### 1.1 Feedback Understanding
- **Extract Specific Issues**: Identify concrete problems, bugs, or improvement opportunities
- **User Journey Mapping**: Determine which user journey(s) are affected
- **Severity Assessment**: Categorize as Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority
- **Specification Alignment**: Compare feedback against PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md requirements

#### 1.2 Issue Categorization
Classify each feedback item into one of these categories:

**üî¥ CRITICAL BUGS** (Production Blockers)
- Features that don't work as intended
- User workflows that fail or produce errors
- Security vulnerabilities or data integrity issues
- Specification violations in implemented features

**üü° USER EXPERIENCE ISSUES** (High Priority)
- Confusing interfaces or unclear user guidance
- Missing feedback or confirmation messages
- Poor error handling or unclear error states
- Accessibility barriers or usability problems

**üü¢ ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES** (Medium Priority)
- Features working correctly but could be improved
- Missing convenience features that would improve workflow
- Performance optimizations or loading improvements
- Visual design or layout improvements

**üîµ SPECIFICATION GAPS** (Feature Development)
- Missing features from PROJECT_SPECIFICATION.md
- New feature requests aligned with platform mission
- Integration opportunities between existing features

### **PHASE 2: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

#### 2.1 Root Cause Analysis
For each identified issue:
- **Current Implementation Status**: What exists and how it currently works
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen according to specification or good UX
- **Technical Root Cause**: Why the gap exists (missing code, logic error, design flaw)
- **Affected Systems**: Which contexts, LiveViews, or components need changes

#### 2.2 Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: How many users and workflows are affected
- **Development Effort**: Realistic time estimate for resolution
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential side effects of proposed changes
- **Test Coverage**: What tests exist and what additional testing is needed

### **PHASE 3: SOLUTION DESIGN**

#### 3.1 Solution Planning
For each issue, design specific solutions:
- **Minimum Viable Fix**: Simplest solution that resolves the core issue
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Complete resolution with proper error handling
- **Future-Proofing**: How to prevent similar issues in the future

#### 3.2 Technical Implementation Plan
- **Code Changes Required**: Specific files, functions, and modifications needed
- **Database Changes**: Any schema modifications or data migrations
- **Test Updates**: New tests needed and existing tests to modify
- **Documentation Updates**: Changes needed in PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md

### **PHASE 4: PRIORITIZED IMPLEMENTATION**

#### 4.1 Work Prioritization
Order issues by:
1. **Critical Bugs** (Fix immediately)
2. **High-Impact UX Issues** (Significant user value)
3. **Specification Compliance** (Missing critical features)
4. **Quality Improvements** (Polish and optimization)

#### 4.2 Development Execution
For each prioritized item:
- **Create Todo List**: Use `create_todo_list` for multi-step work (3+ steps)
- **Follow TDD Approach**: Write failing test ‚Üí implement fix ‚Üí refactor
- **Update Documentation**: Keep PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md current during development
- **Quality Validation**: Use VALIDATE_ALL_TESTS_PASS.md for complex changes
