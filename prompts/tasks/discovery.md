# Discovery Methodology

**Tags**: #discovery #investigation #exploration  
**Purpose**: Systematically explore and understand problem spaces and solution options  
**Configurable**: Yes - Discovery techniques and documentation approaches

## Quick Usage

```
Use #discovery to explore and understand [problem/opportunity/domain]
```

## Full Prompt

Systematically discover and understand new domains:

**1. Problem Space Exploration**
- Define discovery objectives and success criteria
- Identify stakeholders and subject matter experts
- Gather background context and existing knowledge
- Document assumptions and hypotheses to validate

**2. Research and Investigation**
- Conduct stakeholder interviews and surveys
- Research existing solutions and competitive landscape
- Analyze relevant data and metrics
- Review technical constraints and requirements

**3. Solution Space Mapping**
- Identify potential solution approaches
- Evaluate technical feasibility and constraints
- Assess implementation complexity and risks
- Consider integration with existing systems

**4. Validation and Testing**
- Create prototypes or proof-of-concepts to test hypotheses
- Validate assumptions with real users or data
- Test technical approaches and architectures
- Gather feedback and iterate on solutions

**5. Documentation and Recommendations**
- Document findings, insights, and recommendations
- Create decision matrices for solution evaluation
- Identify next steps and resource requirements
- Prepare stakeholder presentations and reports
