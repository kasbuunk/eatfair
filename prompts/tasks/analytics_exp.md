**Configurable**: Yes - Analytics tools and statistical methods

## Quick Usage

```
Use #analytics_exp to design and run [hypothesis] experiment with proper statistical analysis
```

## Full Prompt

Design and execute statistically valid experiments:

**1. Hypothesis Formation**
- Define clear, testable hypothesis
- Identify key metrics and success criteria
- Establish baseline measurements
- Consider potential confounding variables

**2. Experiment Design**
- Choose appropriate experimental methodology
- Define treatment and control groups
- Calculate required sample sizes for statistical power
- Plan randomization and segmentation strategy

**3. Implementation**
- Set up tracking and measurement infrastructure
- Implement experiment variations
- Ensure proper data collection protocols
- Monitor experiment progress and data quality

**4. Analysis and Interpretation**
- Apply appropriate statistical tests
- Calculate confidence intervals and p-values
- Check for statistical significance and practical significance
- Identify potential biases or confounding factors

**5. Conclusions and Action**
- Draw conclusions based on statistical evidence
- Make recommendations for implementation
- Plan follow-up experiments if needed
- Document experiment results and learnings
