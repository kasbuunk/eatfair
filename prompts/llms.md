# LLM Interaction Guidelines

Tags: #llms #ai #prompts #context

*Guidelines for effective interaction with Large Language Models and AI assistants.*

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### Context Management
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed context about what you want
- **Include Examples**: Show examples of desired output format
- **Set Constraints**: Define what should and shouldn't be included
- **State Assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit

### Effective Communication Patterns
- **Task Clarity**: Clearly state the task or question
- **Format Requirements**: Specify desired output format
- **Quality Standards**: Define success criteria
- **Scope Boundaries**: Limit or expand scope as needed

### Iterative Refinement
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts and refine
- **Build Context**: Add context progressively
- **Test Variations**: Try different phrasings for better results
- **Learn from Responses**: Adjust approach based on output quality

## Code-Related Interactions

### Code Review Requests
- **Provide Full Context**: Include relevant file contents
- **State Review Criteria**: Specify what to focus on
- **Include Requirements**: Reference specifications or constraints
- **Ask Specific Questions**: Target areas of concern

### Implementation Requests
- **Define Requirements**: Clear functional requirements
- **Specify Technology**: Language, framework, libraries
- **Include Patterns**: Reference existing code patterns
- **Set Quality Standards**: Testing, performance, security requirements

### Debugging Assistance
- **Include Error Messages**: Full error text and stack traces
- **Provide Reproduction Steps**: How to trigger the issue
- **Share Relevant Code**: Only the code related to the issue
- **Describe Expected Behavior**: What should happen instead

## Documentation and Analysis

### Technical Documentation
- **Target Audience**: Specify who will read this
- **Level of Detail**: How comprehensive should it be
- **Format Requirements**: Structure, sections, style
- **Update Context**: What changed and why

### Code Analysis
- **Analysis Scope**: Which files or components to analyze
- **Focus Areas**: Performance, security, maintainability
- **Comparison Context**: Against what standards or alternatives
- **Output Format**: Reports, summaries, recommendations

## Project-Specific Context

### Domain Knowledge
- **Business Context**: Explain the business domain and requirements
- **User Types**: Define different user roles and needs  
- **Technical Architecture**: Current system design and constraints
- **Quality Standards**: Project-specific quality requirements

### Development Workflow
- **Process Context**: How development works in this project
- **Tool Chain**: Development tools and commands
- **Testing Approach**: Testing philosophy and practices
- **Documentation Standards**: How documentation is maintained

## Quality and Safety

### Validation Approaches
- **Cross-Reference**: Check against multiple sources
- **Test Recommendations**: Validate suggestions with actual code
- **Incremental Implementation**: Make changes step by step
- **Review Results**: Evaluate output quality and correctness

### Security Considerations
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never include passwords, keys, or personal data
- **Sanitize Examples**: Use placeholder data in examples
- **Review Suggestions**: Evaluate security implications of recommendations
- **Follow Best Practices**: Apply security guidelines to AI suggestions

## Collaboration Patterns

### Handoff Between Agents
- **Clear State**: Describe current status and context
- **Next Steps**: Define what needs to happen next
- **Dependencies**: Identify blocking or prerequisite work
- **Success Criteria**: How to know when work is complete

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain important context across interactions
- **Decision Documentation**: Record important decisions and rationale
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and document successful patterns
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve prompts based on experience

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Mistakes
- **Vague Requests**: "Make it better" without specific criteria
- **Missing Context**: Not providing necessary background information
- **Overloading**: Trying to solve too many problems at once
- **Blind Trust**: Accepting all suggestions without validation

### Context Loss Prevention
- **Reference Previous Work**: Link to related conversations or decisions
- **Maintain State**: Keep track of current project state
- **Document Assumptions**: Record implicit knowledge explicitly
- **Version Context**: Track changes in requirements or constraints

## Effectiveness Metrics

### Measuring Success
- **Task Completion**: Did the interaction achieve the goal?
- **Quality Output**: Does the result meet quality standards?
- **Efficiency**: How much back-and-forth was needed?
- **Learning**: Did the interaction improve future prompts?

### Continuous Improvement
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify what prompts work best
- **Failure Analysis**: Understand why some interactions fail
- **Context Optimization**: Improve context provision over time
- **Workflow Integration**: Make AI assistance part of natural workflow
