# Build Custom Admin Dashboard System

*Comprehensive prompt for building a custom admin dashboard system for the EatFair Phoenix application following TDD principles and existing project patterns.*

## üéØ Objective

Build a custom admin dashboard system using Phoenix LiveView to provide comprehensive admin capabilities for all EatFair resources, replacing and extending the current basic admin feedback interface with production-ready admin panels that support the platform's community-driven mission. This approach ensures perfect alignment with existing EatFair patterns and maintains full control over the admin experience.

## üìã Context & Requirements

### Project Context
- **EatFair Mission**: Commission-free platform empowering local restaurant entrepreneurs
- **Architecture**: Phoenix 1.8 + LiveView with scope-based authentication
- **Database**: SQLite with Ecto schemas for all business entities
- **Development Approach**: TDD with comprehensive test coverage required
- **Admin Access Pattern**: Currently uses basic auth in dev, needs role-based access for production

### Current Admin Infrastructure
- Basic admin routes exist in `/admin` with basic auth
- Single admin LiveView: `EatfairWeb.Admin.FeedbackDashboardLive`
- Authentication uses scope system: `@current_scope.user` access pattern
- Admin role validation exists via `require_admin` on_mount hook

## üîç Discovery & Analysis Phase

### 1. Resource Discovery & Mapping
**Automatically discover all EatFair schemas and contexts:**

```elixir
# Schemas to analyze for custom admin integration:
- Eatfair.Accounts.User (customers, restaurant owners, couriers, admins)
- Eatfair.Accounts.Address (delivery addresses)
- Eatfair.Restaurants.Restaurant (restaurant profiles and locations)
- Eatfair.Restaurants.Cuisine (cuisine categories)
- Eatfair.Restaurants.Menu (restaurant menus)
- Eatfair.Restaurants.Meal (individual menu items)
- Eatfair.Orders.Order (customer orders with status tracking)
- Eatfair.Orders.OrderItem (individual items in orders)
- Eatfair.Orders.Payment (payment records)
- Eatfair.Feedback.UserFeedback (user feedback with observability)
- Eatfair.Notifications.Event (notification events)
- Eatfair.Notifications.UserPreference (user notification preferences)
```

**Analysis Requirements:**
1. **Schema Field Analysis**: Map each schema field to appropriate admin dashboard field types
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Identify belongs_to, has_many, many_to_many relationships 
3. **Business Logic Integration**: Preserve existing validations and changesets
4. **Permission Requirements**: Determine admin access levels needed per resource
5. **Search & Filter Needs**: Identify key fields for admin searching and filtering

### 2. Current Admin Interface Assessment
**Examine existing admin infrastructure:**
- Review `EatfairWeb.Admin.FeedbackDashboardLive` patterns
- Analyze authentication and authorization flows
- Document current admin user experience gaps
- Identify admin workflow pain points
