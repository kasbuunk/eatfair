# Security Incident Report: Google Maps API Key Exposure

**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Incident Type**: API Key Exposure in Git History  

## Summary

A Google Maps API key was accidentally exposed in the git commit history through log files that were committed to the repository.

## Details

### Exposed Credential
- **Type**: Google Maps API Key
- **Key**: AIzaSyBJH1Vzqakt-_CnqjkoEF6uEWjjFDxI5_c (COMPROMISED)
- **First Exposure**: Commit 0844055fc807b092b66e1e54261a014d439afa17 (2025-08-27)
- **Additional Exposure**: Commit a19a0c5 (log removal attempt)

### Affected Commits
1. `0844055` - "feat: complete location geocoding system with google maps api integration"
2. `a19a0c5` - "chore: rm log from git" (attempted to remove logs but key remained in history)

### Discovery Method
The API key was found in error logs that were accidentally committed as part of development log files. The key appeared in CaseClauseError messages during application startup.

### Impact Assessment
- **Exposure Duration**: ~1 day (2025-08-27 to 2025-08-28)
- **Repository Access**: Private repository, limited exposure
- **Service Impact**: Google Maps API key could potentially be used by unauthorized parties if accessed

## Resolution Actions Taken

### Immediate Response
1. ‚úÖ **Identified all occurrences** of the API key in git history
2. ‚úÖ **Created backup** of repository before remediation
3. ‚úÖ **Removed API key from git history** using git-filter-repo with text replacement
4. ‚úÖ **Verified complete removal** from all commits and branches

### Technical Details
- Used `git-filter-repo --replace-text` to replace all instances of the key with `***REMOVED***`
- Processed 58 commits, completely rewriting git history
- Original git remote was removed as part of the history rewrite process
- Repository backup created at: `../eatfair-backup-{timestamp}`

### Commands Executed
```bash
# Search for API key exposure
git log --all -S"AIzaSyBJH1Vzqakt-_CnqjkoEF6uEWjjFDxI5_c" --oneline

# Create backup
cp -r eatfair eatfair-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Remove from git history
git-filter-repo --replace-text <(echo "AIzaSyBJH1Vzqakt-_CnqjkoEF6uEWjjFDxI5_c==>***REMOVED***") --force
```

## Required Next Steps

### üö® CRITICAL - Still Required
1. **REVOKE the compromised API key immediately**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials
   - Find and delete the compromised key: AIzaSyBJH1Vzqakt-_CnqjkoEF6uEWjjFDxI5_c
   
2. **Generate new API key**
   - Create replacement Google Maps API key
   - Update environment variables in development and production
   - Test location services functionality

3. **Update remote repository** (if applicable)
   - Force push the cleaned history to remote repositories
   - Notify team members to re-clone the repository
   - Update any CI/CD pipelines that might cache the old history

### Security Improvements
1. **Add .env files to .gitignore** (if not already present)
2. **Implement pre-commit hooks** to scan for potential secrets
3. **Review logging practices** to prevent sensitive data from being logged
4. **Consider using secret management tools** for production deployments

## Lessons Learned

1. **Log file management**: Development logs containing sensitive information should never be committed
2. **Environment variable loading**: Error handling in environment variable loading exposed the key value
3. **Secret scanning**: Need for automated secret detection in pre-commit hooks
4. **History rewriting**: git-filter-repo is effective for complete secret removal from git history

## Verification

- ‚úÖ API key completely removed from git history
- ‚úÖ No occurrences found in current working directory
- ‚úÖ Repository backup created successfully
- ‚è≥ API key revocation pending (user action required)
- ‚è≥ New API key generation pending (user action required)

## Follow-up Items

This incident should be reviewed in the next security assessment to ensure proper secret management practices are in place.
